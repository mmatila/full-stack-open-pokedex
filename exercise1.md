## CI/CD for a Java project

Linting tool: Probably Checkstyle since I've used it in the early CS courses already
Testing: Unit testing with JUnit. For integration tests, DBUnit popped up first on Google
Building: Gradle or Apache Maven. I think I've gotten to try both in some courses already

### Alternatives for Jenkins and Github Actions

- CircleCI
- GitLab CI

### Self-hosted or cloud-based environment?

Since the project would most likely be just a small personal project, I think I'd be better off by using a cloud-based solution.
Mostly just budget-wise but it'll also be way easier for me to get going without the additional hassle by setting up the whole
self-hosted environment. Of course it'd be a great learning experience and I definitely should do that at some point, but not now.
